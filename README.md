# University-Database-Management
This project is a University Management System developed using PostgreSQL. It efficiently manages various operations within a university, including data entry, relationships between tables, and querying information. The system is designed to ensure proper database normalization, ensuring smooth and organized data flow.

Key Features:

Data Entry & Management:
Handles the insertion of data into multiple tables while maintaining referential integrity between entities such as students, courses, faculty, departments, and more.
Relationships: Manages one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, ensuring accurate representation of real-world university operations.
Advanced Database Operations:
Cursors: Used to process rows returned by queries in a controlled manner.
Functions: Encapsulated reusable logic for operations and data manipulation.
Procedures: Perform actions that allow efficient handling of complex tasks.
Triggers: Automatically enforce rules and maintain data integrity when certain conditions are met.

Query Capabilities:
In addition to managing university data, the system also allows complex queries for extracting meaningful insights, ensuring easy retrieval of information such as student grades, course enrollments, faculty schedules, and more.

This project showcases database concepts and demonstrates proficiency in using PostgreSQL's powerful features to build a fully functioning university management system.
